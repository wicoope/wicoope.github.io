## Description
A brief description of your project, including its purpose and main functionality. For example:

This project demonstrates a simple web application where the backend retrieves data from a database and displays it on the frontend. The application is built using AWS services such as EC2, RDS, and S3.

## Features
- Fetch data from a database and display it dynamically on a web page.
- Deployed on AWS with scalable architecture.
- Lightweight and easy to modify for additional features.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) (specify your project language)
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials
- A running instance of RDS and EC2 in AWS

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    cd project-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or for Python:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    DB_USER=your-username
    DB_PASSWORD=your-password
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or for Python:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (adjust the port as needed).

## Deployment
To deploy the application on AWS:
1. Use the AWS CLI or Management Console to configure and launch EC2, RDS, and S3 services.
2. Push your application files to the EC2 instance.
3. Ensure the necessary ports are open for web traffic.
4. Connect the backend to the RDS instance using environment variables.
